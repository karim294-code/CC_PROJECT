       In this assignment, we exchanged the body parts of each other’s characters. It was fascinating to see the variety of colors and dimensions that everyone had used. I struggled with capturing the different hand and leg movements accurately, and getting the precise measurements of the character was also challenging. To manage this, I started with a basic drawing and tried to incorporate all the exchanged body parts as best as I could. Throughout the process, my goal was to eventually recreate the exact image I envisioned, and while it didn’t turn out perfectly, I am happy with how closely it resembles what we exchanged.
