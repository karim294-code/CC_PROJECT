      <p>
 For this assignment, I decided to create a cat face generator that changes expression when the mouse interacts with it. My goal was to give the cat personality and life through subtle parameter changes. When the mouse hovers over the cat, its mouth opens and the eyes change expression, making it look more playful or surprised.
Through this project, I learned how parameters and interactivity can completely transform a static design into something dynamic and engaging. Adjusting the size and position of simple shapes like ellipses and triangles helped me understand how small details affect emotion and character. Using mouseX, mouseY, and mousePressed() (or hover detection) taught me how code can act like a design tool, allowing me to explore many variations of a single form without redrawing it each time.
