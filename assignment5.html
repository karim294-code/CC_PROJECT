      <p>
       For this assignment, I understood the concept of for loops and wanted to make an optical illusion that has 2 yo-yos colliding. 
The concept is that the yo-yos start on opposite sides and they move towards each other and when they collide, they change their color once. They continue back to the edges, then reset to loop infinitely. The animation is smooth because it runs inside draw (). 
The challenging part was collision so I took the help of chat gpt to understand how to do that and have the yo-yos change the color at the same time. Then I adjusted the speed of which they were moving closer to each other.
