      <p>
       Creating this walking simulator became more than just a coding assignment for me it became a way of visually re telling my own journey of moving between Karachi and New York, two places that have shaped who I am in completely different yet interconnected ways. As I designed the scenes, characters, and collectible items in the game, I realized that I was actually mapping out the emotional landscapes of my life.
The first scene, set in Karachi, represents the foundation of my creativity. Growing up surrounded by color, energy, and cultural symbolism, I learned to see design everywhere in truck art, in patterns, in the smallest details of daily life. The items the player collects in this scene mirror pieces of my own childhood identity: the chai, the samosa, the chaand, the flower.<br>By coding the items to appear randomly and requiring the player to explore the space to collect them, I tried to express how my own sense of self was formed by wandering, observing, and absorbing everything around me.
The second scene, inspired by New York, captures the simultaneous shock and excitement of arriving in a place that feels massive, cold, and full of possibilities. The items a MetroCard, coffee cup, graffiti tag, and sketchbook represent the small but significant things that helped me adapt to the rhythm of the city. New York challenged me, pushed me, and forced me to grow. In this scene, the player has to move faster, collect new symbols, and adjust to a more modern environment. <br>This mirrors my real experience: learning how to navigate a new world, while still trying to hold onto my roots.
The final fusion scene is the heart of the game and the heart of my reflection. It symbolizes the moment I stopped thinking of my identity as split between two places. Instead of choosing between cultures, I began to combine them. The fusion character wearing a puffer jacket with Ajrak details, neon truck-art flowers glowing in the New York skyline, and snow mixed with Karachi sunlight reflect the merging of worlds inside me. This scene represents the transformation that happens when you stop trying to “fit in” and start allowing your background to inform your vision.
Coding this project taught me that technical work and personal storytelling can coexist beautifully.
